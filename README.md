# Modeling-soft-sensor-by-NN
This repo contains a file which models soft sensor by both closed form solution of regression and Neural Network. 
1. Processed_09142020.csv contains all the collect data from self-built soft sensor. It includes force and sensing infomation(voltage).
2. The Soft sensor_modeling applies NN algorithm and closed form solution of regression which models the soft sensor's behavior.
